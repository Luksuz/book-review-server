# Book Reviews Server ðŸ“š

## Overview

This repository contains the backend server for a book reviews application. The server manages user authentication, book reviews, comments, and interactions between users.

### Key Features:

- **User Authentication**: Provides secure user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
  
- **Book Reviews**: Allows users to post, edit, and delete book reviews.
  
- **Comments and Likes**: Enables users to comment on reviews, like/dislike comments, and interact with each other.

## Technologies Used:

- Django
- MySql (Database for storing books, reviews, and user data)
- CSFR Token for authentication
- RESTful API design principles


## Deployment and Setup:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-reviews-server.git
   cd book-reviews-server
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py

2.	The server should now be running on http://localhost:3000 by default. Use tools like Postman or integrate with a frontend application to interact with the API endpoints.

## Next Steps

	â€¢	Enhance security by implementing input validation, rate limiting, and HTTPS for production deployment.
	â€¢	Implement data pagination, sorting, and filtering for better scalability with large datasets.
	â€¢	Expand functionality with additional features such as user profiles, notifications, and social sharing of reviews.
